# Phraseman — Claude instructions

## MASON — content scriptwriter pipeline

If the user says **"MASON"**, "мейсон", "подними мейсон", or **"пишем новый ролик"** —
load the content pipeline: **read `content/MASON.md` FIRST** and follow its step-by-step
instructions exactly (read DOSSIER.md + CLARKSON_STYLE.md, write a ready-to-voice short-video
script in Clarkson's-Farm style on RU, save it to `content/scripts/ГГГГ-ММ-ДД_*.md`).

MASON is self-contained in `content/` — any AI, any session continues from those files.

## LINGMAN — educational scriptwriter pipeline (DIFFERENT channel)

If the user says **"LINGMAN"**, "лингман", **"пишем новый урок"**, or **"следующее видео"** —
load the OTHER content pipeline: **read `content/lingman/LINGMAN.md` FIRST** and follow its
step-by-step instructions exactly. This is the EDUCATIONAL English channel (Professor Lingman
voice, audience 40+/50+, long ~10-12 min "phrase chain" videos, native Phraseman integration).
It writes a ready-to-read teleprompter script (one continuous RU text) to
`content/lingman/scripts/ГГГГ-ММ-ДД_NNN_*.md` and updates `content/lingman/memory/`.

> ⚠️ MASON ≠ LINGMAN. MASON = behind-the-scenes dev channel (Shorts, Clarkson style, hero "Максим").
> LINGMAN = teaching channel about English (Professor Lingman voice). Do not mix them.

LINGMAN is self-contained in `content/lingman/` — any AI, any session continues from those files.

> Project-wide engineering rules also live in `AGENTS.md`.

## Performance Bible (MANDATORY for any new screen/feature/UI change)

Before creating or editing screens, tabs, animations, data loading, or content files —
read **`AGENTS.md` → «Performance Bible (Instagram-Grade Runtime)»** and follow it exactly:
frozen background (freezeOnBlur/react-freeze + guarded loops), instant first frame
(sync hydration from snapshot/peek, no default-then-patch, no full-screen spinners),
constant stack background, lazy content through registry accessors (the seam for the
planned server-side content delivery). Guarded by `tests/perf_freeze_contract.test.ts` —
never weaken the guards to make a feature pass; extend allowlists only consciously.
